# 🍔 hamBurger Website - HTML Landing Page

## 📌 About the Project

This is a **Burger Website Landing Page** built using only **HTML**.  
It is my **Day 3 project** of the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge. I'm currently learning the basics of web development, and this project helped me practice creating a structured layout with food item cards.

> ⚠️ Note: The CSS used in this project is **AI-generated** since I'm still learning how to write custom CSS. The main goal here was to improve my **HTML structuring and semantic skills**.

---

## 💡 What I Built

- A hero section with a catchy heading, subtext, and CTA button
- Burger images with prices and descriptions
- A clean layout for food menu using cards
- HTML5 semantic structure using tags like `section`, `article`, `div`, and `img`

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Organizing content with sections and semantic elements  
- Creating product-style cards for food items  
- Adding images and aligning text properly  
- Clean, readable HTML code with consistent indentation
